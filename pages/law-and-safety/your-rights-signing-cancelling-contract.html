                            <p>This contract must contain all the details of the purchase and any credit terms you’ve
                                agreed to.</p>

                            <p>Always remember to read and understand the terms and conditions before signing.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-0">Rules about contracts under the <abbr title="Consumer Protection Act">CPA</abbr></h2>

                            <p>Contracts are different depending on their purpose. But under the <cite>Consumer
                                    Protection Act</cite>, all contracts must contain a few common details to make sure
                                your rights are protected.</p>

                            <p><strong>All terms of the agreement</strong></p>

                            <p>A contract must clearly show the terms of your agreement with the business.</p>

                            <p>All fees and charges must be what they say they are. For example, a business may not add
                                a $20 surcharge for a “tax” that does not exist. Make sure you understand what each
                                charge is for and that it’s valid.</p>

                            <p>If your contract has a <a href="/consumers/your-rights-under-consumer-protection-act#section-0">cooling-off
                                    period</a>, the contract must mention this information. It must also include
                                details on how they will deal with the cancellation if you change your mind within that
                                time.</p>

                            <p><strong>Estimates in the contract</strong></p>

                            <p>If a written estimate is included in the contract, the final price cannot be more than
                                10% above the estimate, unless you agree to a new price and sign a change to the
                                contract. Make sure that any written estimate you receive is part of the contract, so
                                that this 10% rule will apply.</p>

                            <p>If you are charged more than 10% above a written estimate without agreeing to it, you
                                can demand that the final price be adjusted.</p>

                            <p>If a business refuses to adjust the price, you can <a href="/consumers/filing-consumer-complaint">file
                                    a complaint with the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Your right to seek help</strong></p>

                            <p>Some businesses add clauses to a contract that say that you must use a private
                                arbitration process to resolve complaints instead of going to court or seeking
                                assistance from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. <strong>You are not
                                    bound by these clauses, even if you have accepted the agreement.</strong></p>

                            <p>You always have the right to <a href="/contact-us">seek
                                    help for your dispute by contacting us</a> or taking legal action.</p>

                            <p><strong>Credit terms must be fully presented</strong></p>

                            <p>The contract must show all financing charges and the annual interest rate for any
                                financing agreement with the business. It must also explain how any extra charges would
                                be calculated if you failed to make the payments.</p>

                            <p><strong>Changing, renewing or extending without your permission</strong></p>

                            <p>The business must provide you with written notice of any changes that they want to make
                                to your contract. This includes renewing or extending it. They must also provide you
                                with the option to not accept the changes to your contract.</p>

                            <p>Under the <abbr title="Consumer Protection Act">CPA</abbr>, a written notice must
                                include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>all proposed changes to be made to the contract</li>
                                <li>the date on which the change, renewal or extension would become effective</li>
                                <li>how the consumer must respond to the notice (mail, email, fax, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>)</li>
                                <li>what would happen if the consumer failed to respond to the notice</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If a business doesn’t follow these rules, any changes to your contract are invalid. You
                                don’t have to pay for any charges or fees that are a result of invalid changes to your
                                contract.</p>

                            <p>In these cases, you can write the business to ask for a correction or refund. If a
                                business refused to correct the mistake, you can file a complaint with the Ministry of
                                Government and Consumer Services.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h2 id="section-1">Cancelling a contract</h2>

                            <p>When you cancel a contract, any other arrangements you made with the purchase, like a
                                financing agreement, are also cancelled.</p>

                            <p>Under the <cite>Consumer Protection Act</cite>,&nbsp; you have the right to cancel a
                                contract and have your money returned if one of the following applies to you:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>The contract has a cooling-off period</strong></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>You always have a cooling-off period when you sign a contract in your home. Other
                                contracts may also have <a href="/consumers/your-rights-under-consumer-protection-act#section-0">cooling-off
                                    periods</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>In those cases, you can cancel the contract for any reason within 10 days of receiving a
                                written copy of the agreement. Water heater contracts have a 20-day cooling-off period
                                that begins on the date that you sign the contract in your home.</p>

                            <p>Send your cancellation letter by email or by registered mail so that you have a record
                                of when you sent it. Be sure to keep a copy of your letter.</p>

                            <p>For most contracts, the company has 15 days to return your money. For payday loans, the
                                company has to give you a refund within 2 days. If the contract was for a product, they
                                are responsible for picking up the product or paying for it to be picked up if they
                                want it back.</p>
